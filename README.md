# Master's thesis code #

The code used for my master's thesis on *Grating lobe errors in synthetic aperture sonar images* is provided in this repository. The code was run with MATLAB R2022b. 

## Overview

The code developed for the grating lobe study in Chapter 3 in my thesis is in the [Grating lobe study folder](Grating-lobe-study).

The aperture smoothing function model is provided in the [ASF model folder](ASF-model). 

A small summary of what each of the files do is provided in the folders.
